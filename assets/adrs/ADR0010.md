# Architectural Decision Record
## Date
6/1/22 

## Title
Separate Persistent Storage vs Analytics Storage

## Status
Rejected

## Context 
The platform will have separate persistent and analytic store.

## Decision
Rejected - Would require additional development, infrastructure, increase complexity and could quickly lead to additional cost. 
Also the decision to use GraphDB for the persistent data storage layer [ADR0005 - Persistent Data Store](/assets/adrs/ADR0005.md) allows for dynamic and powerful reporting options allowing us to analyze and produce reports on various key relationships between the actors in the Spotlight Platform.

## Consequences
Will need to closely monitor the performance characteristics of the persistent storage.
