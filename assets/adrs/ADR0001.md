## Considered Options
  The decision on whether or not to include an Interactive Voice Recognition system boils down to whether or not the increased cost of having IVR is within the budget of the Diversity Counsil for this system. We feel that the additional users that it would bring to the system to utilize the services would be a huge benefit to the candidates that they support. Additinally, making the services more highly available to those candidates who could greatly benefit from these services.
  
## Decision Drivers
  * Increased benefit to low income candidates: Provides access to NPO services to a wider audience, including those who may not have access to a computer or smart phone.
  * Cost of IVR Software: The additional cost of IVR software system licenses are worth the increased reach of the benefits provided to a wider audience.
  
## Decision
Approve the inclusion of an IVR system to enable candidates to access training lists, schedules and information from any phone.

## Consequences
Additional development required<BR>
Additional infrastructure required<BR>
Additional costs of IVR server software licenses
Expanded reach to candidates
