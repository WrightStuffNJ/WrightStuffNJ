# Architectural Decision Record
## Date
5/27/22 

## Title
Use Miro for Diagrams

## Status
Rejected

## Context 
We should use Miro for our diagrams so that they are publicly accessible.

## Decision
Rejected

## Reasoning
The entire team is well versed in Lucidchart, as it is the standard at NetJets. 
Due to the tight timeframe of the contest we decided that adding any learning curve to the project would be counterproductive.

## Consequences
Improved speed of design documents
Inability to use linked content in our documentation due to the audience's likely lack of Lucid licenses. This will require updating document images every time a change is made to the diagrams.
