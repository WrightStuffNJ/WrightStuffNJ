# Architectural Decision Record
## Date
6/1/22 

## Title
Workflow

## Status
Accepted

## Context 
The Spotlight Platform will utilize workflow. This will allow the platform to guide the users through their particular journeys; Non-profit providers will be walked through the process of creating a community profile, completing a service capabilities assessment and connecting with the community. ​

Candidates will be guided through the process of completing career profiles and assessments before being connected with a mentor.​

We felt this was important, so that the providers and candidates do not need to be trained before using the platform; they can sign up and begin using the platform immediately.​
