# Architectural Decision Record
## Date

## Title
Use Message Queuing

## Status
Rejected

## Context 
We should use message queuing to isolate components.

## Decision
Rejected

## Consequences
Our analysis of the system interactions indicates that elastic scaling can manage nearly all trafic situations, with minimal loss of transactions. Message queuing will add overhead to the system, reducing responsiveness and increasing costs. It was decided that in the rare cases where a transaction is missed, users seing a 'please retry' message was worth the reduction in overall costs.
